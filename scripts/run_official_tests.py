"""Parity gate: run the official Spark Connect test suite through OUR Rust client.

Now that the client is at full parity, we no longer run the reference client on every
file to compute a per-file baseline (that doubled CI time). Instead we run ONLY our
client (via the Rust transport-injection plugin, scripts/rust_transport_plugin.py) and
require every test to pass, except a checked-in manifest of *known environmental
failures* (scripts/parity_known_failures.txt) - tests the reference client also fails
in this single-node pure-Connect CI environment. Those are deselected for our run too.

Any test that fails and is NOT in the manifest is a genuine problem: either a client
regression, or a new environmental failure. Regenerate the manifest with
scripts/gen_parity_skiplist.py (which runs the reference client) to reclassify, and
commit the update if it is environmental.

# a resource-starved single-node server, yet pass reliably in isolation. ONLY these
# get retried; every other file is expected to be deterministic, so a
